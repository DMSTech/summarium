# Summarium README

Product Vision:

A flexible web-based edition delivery method that supports multiple pathways to entry and the ability for users to add annotations of many sorts: from simple text, to links to references and additional information.

The prototype will display a single text from the Summarium (Book of Esther) in fifteen different witnesses.  It will include already-transcribed text, and available images.
